# finetune-anything

## Introduction

The [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) has revolutionized computer vision. Relying on fine-tuning of SAM will solve a large number of basic computer vision tasks. We are designing an easy-to-use tool for training fine-tuning models based on SAM.

You need to supply the datasets for your tasks and the [supported task](#Supported-Tasks) name, this tool will help you to get a finetuned model for your task.

The code is coming soon.
